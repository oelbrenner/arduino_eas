# air suspension controller


## basic operation
each wheel has a height sensor which provides the following values via resistance measurement:



max ground clearance (high ride height)
upper range
lower range

min ground clearance (low ride height)
upper range
lower range

to change the ride height, solenoid valves have to be opened 

The four height sensors monitor the difference in height between the body of the vehicle and the wheels - one for each wheel. Information is received from each sensor by the electronic control unit (ECU) and is used to maintain, add or release air in each air spring by a series of valves

When lowering the vehicle, the outlet and diaphragm valve, and air spring valves activate, and air is expelled through the air dryer and the exhaust silencer.

When raising the vehicle, the inlet and air spring valves activate, and air is sent into the air springs inflating them
